# hashmap_data_migrator packaging

## About

The purpose of this document is to help setup sub package for a hashmap_data_migrator source.

## Assumption
- a gitlab sub repository already available for the source. The repository can be empty.<br>
    e.g. hashmap_data_migrator-Netezza

## Steps to create a new sub repository
Note: {source_name} is the name of the source for which we want to create sub package.
- create a new gitlab sub repository manually. Repo naming convention: hashmap_data_migrator-{source_name}<br>
  e.g. hashmap_data_migrator-netezza
  
- copy and paste netezza_config.py under hashmap_data_migrator -> clone -> config folder. 
Rename new file to  {source_name}_config.py <br>
  e.g. netezza_config.py
  
- open the {source_name}_config.py 
    - rename class name
    - add/update files wherever needed.
    
- open file clone_main.py in hashmap_data_migrator root folder and add the following lines: 
```
      {source_name} = CloneProcess({source_name}Config())
      {source_name}.clone_repo() 

   e.g. 
        netezza = CloneProcess(NetezzaConfig())
        netezza.clone_repo()
```  
## Important!!!!
- for any new files added/renamed/moved/removed related to a source, the corresponding clone config file needs 
to be updated.

## Issues
If the build fails on packaging, check the below:
- gitlab access token is set and is not expired.
- gitlab sub repository is available for the source.
